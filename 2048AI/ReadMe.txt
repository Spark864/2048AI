Beta2048 - a Python AI for playing 2048
How to execute:
1. Ensure numpy and tkinter are installed on your machine. If later steps error with a message that either of these are not installed, they can be using:
> pip install numpy
> pip install tkinter
	or through the installer of your choice.
2. Open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing "game_ai.py", "game_functions.py", "game_display.py"
3. Enter:
> py game_display.py
4. Press "P" on your keyboard with the 2048 window selected to begin AI gameplay.
	Do not navigate away from the window during AI gameplay. Tkinter will cause the window to hang. If this happens, simply force close the window and begin again.
